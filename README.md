 🌱 **Precision Irrigation System (IoT + ML + Web Application)**

**Overview**

This project is an IoT-enabled Precision Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage in agriculture by monitoring soil and environmental parameters in real time and using Machine Learning (ML) to make smart irrigation decisions.

The system integrates IoT sensors, a cloud database, and a web application to provide farmers with actionable insights. It monitors the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and rainfall status, and uses weather forecast data along with plant-specific requirements to predict:

* Whether irrigation is needed
* Expected irrigation duration
* Potential water savings

This helps farmers conserve water, reduce costs, and improve crop yield by applying the right amount of water at the right time.



 ✨ **Features**

* 📡 IoT Sensor Integration: Real-time data collection of

  * Soil Moisture
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Light Intensity
  * Rain Detection
* ☁️ Cloud Database (Firebase/other backend): Centralized data storage for easy access.
* 🌍 Web Application:

  * **User-friendly dashboard** for farmers to monitor live field conditions.
  * **Visualization of historical trends and analytics.**
  * **Mobile/desktop access.**
* 🤖 **Machine Learning Model:**

  * Predicts irrigation requirement.
  * Suggests optimal irrigation time.
  * Estimates water savings.
* 📊 **Decision Support System: Combines real-time IoT data + weather forecast + plant needs to guide farmers.**



 🛠️**Tech Stack**

* Hardware (IoT Sensors): Soil moisture, DHT11/DHT22 (temperature & humidity), LDR (light intensity), LCD Display, Micro Servo Motor, Bread-Board and resistors, LEDs, microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32/NodeMCU).
* Software Components:
* Arduino IDE/TinkerCad
* Backend: Firebase ,Cloud Platform: ThingSpeak/Blynk/FireBase
* Frontend: Web Application (React.js / HTML-CSS-JS).
* Machine Learning: Random Forest, LSTM
* Hosting: Firebase Hosting / Any web hosting service.



🚀 **Workflow**

1. Sensors collect data from the field.
2. Microcontroller uploads data to cloud (Firebase).
3. Web app dashboard fetches and displays real-time conditions.
4. ML model processes data with weather forecast & plant-specific thresholds.
5. Prediction results (irrigation need, duration, water savings) are displayed to farmers.



🌾 **Impact**

* 💧 Saves significant water resources by avoiding over-irrigation.
* 🌿 Increases crop productivity and health.
* 📉 Reduces operational costs for farmers.
* 📈 Enables data-driven farming decisions.





 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

* 🌐 Mobile application for farmers (Android/iOS).
* 🌤️ Advanced weather forecast integration (API-based).
* 🤝 Support for multiple crop profiles & recommendation engine.
* 🔔 SMS/WhatsApp notifications for irrigation alerts.
* 🛰️ Integration with satellite/remote sensing data.
