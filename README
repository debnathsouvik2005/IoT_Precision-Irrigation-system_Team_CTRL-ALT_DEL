# IoT Precision Irrigation System for Smart Agriculture

***

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **IoT-based Precision Irrigation System** combining advanced sensor networks, machine learning algorithms, and automated controls to optimize water use in agriculture. It addresses major agricultural challenges like water scarcity, climate unpredictability, and labor-intensive irrigation management.

***

## Problem Statement

- Agriculture consumes 70% of global freshwater, with ~50% wasted due to inefficient irrigation.
- Climate change imposes unpredictable weather patterns affecting traditional irrigation.
- Manual irrigation management is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
- Lack of real-time data leads to suboptimal yields and resource waste.
- Existing systems are often expensive, limiting adoption by small-scale farmers.

## Solution

Develop an **intelligent precision irrigation platform** that:  

- Monitors multi-parameters: soil moisture (multi-depth), temperature, humidity, light intensity, and precipitation.  
- Uses ML predictive analytics to forecast irrigation needs based on historical data and environmental patterns.  
- Employs an adaptive control system with automated valve actuation and manual override via mobile app.  
- Integrates weather forecasting APIs for proactive and optimized irrigation scheduling.  
- Provides rugged, IP68-rated hardware for harsh outdoor conditions.  
- Offers scalable and modular architecture suitable for 0.25 to 10+ acres.
